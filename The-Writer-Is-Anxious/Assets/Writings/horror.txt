#紧接romance剧情。巨大的zombie出现了。zombie我分开存的，拼一下就好。zombie出现的时候是从远到近，跳着逐渐靠近。
#同时，在horror版块，底端会出现字幕。这个字幕代表着其他人所说的话，且会随着时间推进。在下一个剧情点被触发之后，当前未说完的话会被cut掉。当用这种机制的时候我会标注“滚动字幕”来表示。

#说回zombie。zombie只有打头（z）会死。打其他部位（字母），该字母会被打消失，但是zombie的行动不会被影响。在zombie靠近到一定地步之后，如果player仍未打倒僵尸，princess会出手打倒僵尸。

#zombie在相对较远的地方，滚动字幕：
Princess: That's... so gross.
Princess: What are they?
Princess: Knight, we need to do something!

#zombie在相对靠近的地方，滚动字幕：
Princess: It's getting closer!
Princess: Try to find its weakness!
Princess: God bless everyone in our kingdom...

#------
#如果player成功击倒zombie，在空白画面中出现字幕：
...Slash!
You wave your sword without hestitation. In a second, the creature's head is crushed. 
Blood spills everywhere.

You gently turn your head back.

	#仍然是romance的ui风格，princess的立绘不变
Princess:
...that was close.
Thank you for protecting me, Knight. (Love+ 20)

	#选项：
It's my pleasure. ->A
What shall we do next? ->B
Is it dragon who created them? ->C

	#A
Princess:
You are doing good.
I'll tell my father everything at our return.
But for now, let's focus on something else.

	#B
Princess:
...I'd really like to get back to our kingdom and protect my people.
But I think I'd better deal with something more complicated here.

	#C
Princess:
W-why?
What makes you think of that?
	
		#选项：
It's said that he has the evilest power...
It's just my insight.

Princess:
...

Princess:
Nevertheless, Dragon is dead. Right under your sword.
But these creatures did not vanish with Dragon.

#------
#如果player没有击败zombie:
...BOOM!
On the enormous sound, the creature's head is crushed.
Blood spills everywhere.

You gently turn your head back.

	#仍然是romance的ui风格，princess的立绘变成princess_shotgun
Princess:
...that was close. (Love-10)

Princess:
This gun?
I just found it in the bushes there.

	#选项：
What is going on? ->A
What shall we do next? ->B
Is it dragon who created them? ->C

	#此时立绘变回普通。
	#A
Princess:
I don't know neither.
But I had witnessed them once... at an earlier time.
Listen to me, Knight, I want to do something...

	#B
Princess:
...I'd really like to get back to our kingdom and protect my people.
But I think I'd better deal with something more complicated here.

	#C
Princess:
W-why?
What makes you think of that?
	
		#选项：
It's said that he has the evilest power...
It's just my insight.

Princess:
...

Princess:
Nevertheless, Dragon is dead. Right under your sword.
But these creatures did not vanish with Dragon.

#分支结束，接下来是共同剧情
#------

Princess:		
I want to discover the nest of these creatures. Then destroy it.
That's the only way to protect my kingdom from their attack.
(when love < 50) Will you come with me, Knight?
(when love >= 50) I'd really like you to come with me. Will you, Knight?

#选项：
Sure. That sounds cool. -> A
The only reason I'm here is to protect you from any danger, my princess. -> B

#A:
Princess:
Thank you.

#B:
Princess: (blush)
Thank you... (love + 10)

#无姓名框和立绘，在对话框里
Out of a sudden, you think you hear something. Thin in the air.
Is that a man's voice? Or a boy's?
You can't tell where it came from.

Princess:
...

#选项：
Did you hear that?
I heard a voice.

Princess:
...
Yes. I heard that.
That might come from the cave not far away...
There used to be the dragon's nest.

#变成自行移动，这里我想的是第一人称，主角自动往前走，然后遇敌会停下来。Princess和其他人都是AI自动控制。Princess的图是princess_shotgun_small，自动面向镜头。如果要加的话，可以右手左右移动控制镜头方向（微调，大概在30度以内），但是走路方向还是不变的。这样可以保证玩家需要操作的地方很少。
#UI方面，princess的头像和hp放左下角。knight的头像和hp放右下角。头像是ui_xx。血条做了一个简陋的是ui_hp。
#hp满格应该是20，和之前dragon战的hp共享。此时每被僵尸挠一下-2。
#搭建场景都用2d图像，然后控制图片面向镜头。

#一开始往cave走。走到cave就可以胜利。中间会遇一次敌。
#在没遇敌前：（随机滚动字幕）（随机即没有特定顺序）
Princess: I'll cover you if anything goes wrong!
Princess: We need to be quick and quiet.
Princess: Hope my father would be safe...

#遇敌之后：
Princess: Crap! They're here!
#以下为随机滚动字幕：
Princess: Slash them on their head!
Princess: Come on! You can do it!
Princess: Don't let them near you!
#当zombie过于靠近，被zombie挠了一下之后：
Princess: No!
Princess: Hold on, I got you!

#结束战斗之后： （随机滚动字幕）
Princess: That was pretty close.
Princess: We'll be safe here.
Princess: Dragon's smell will erase our traces.

#进入cave。画面变黑。ui暂时消失。最上面是light_word。点击之后，light_yellow开始闪烁。在闪烁中可以看到字幕：
You follow Princess into the cave.
It is dark here. Dark -- but huge. You could tell according to your battle experience of years.
Lights over your head are dim yellow. Occasionally you can see some bats hanged beside.
#这里还想做一个bat出现然后用手按住屏幕滑动可以把bat 赶走。

Suddenly, Princess stops, and pushes open a wooden door.
You are surprised by what you see. It is a big room with weapons and bullets. Right at the corner, a man and a boy are tied by ropes.
You quickly run to them and untie the ropes.
#点击untie之后，rope逐渐变成一根线滑到画面左下角，变成rope.png。这个动画我之后会做。然后在下一次灯光闪烁的时候，table+bullets+gun/handgun+princess+man+capboy都会出现。

#滚动字幕：
Man: Thank god that you heard us... Thank you, young man, and the girl there - 
Princess: My name is Princess. This is Knight. We are both from Country nearby this forest.
Cap Boy: What happened to that big dragon?
Princess: Dragon is slayed by this brave knight. You shall not worry any more.
Man: For god's sake! You must be the hero in the country.
Princess: However, the outside world is filled with those creepy green creatures...
Cap Boy: Zombies.
Man: ZomBEEs?
Cap Boy: Just guess that's their name.
Princess: Me and Knight decide to find out the origin of them.
Cap Boy: In that case, I know a place that you might be interested.
Princess: You really do?
Cap Boy: Well. Those things are *born* there anyway. You wanna come or not?
Princess: ... Yes, I will. And you will, too - right, Knight?
Man: Wow. Then count me in too. I can't let a small girl go on an adventure on her own.
Man: And - you should carry a gun, young man. That sword can't work well on these green things.

#字幕滚动一次就结束，在任何时机都可以点击left离开洞穴。右下角放shiny的图片，一直在闪烁，点击的话dragonscale会出现。

#出了cave之后，ui再次出现，princess,man,capboy在左下角，knight的ui在右下角。由于进了saferoom所以hp补满。
#仍然是和之前一样的操作方式。在每一轮的攻击之中npc掉血是随机的。但要保持princess和boy在city地图前不会死。

#forest 地图，主要是mist，tree和bush的组合。总遇敌一波。没有隐藏敌人。
#剧情滚动字幕：（遇敌前）
Man: Everything ready. What's the plan?
Cap Boy: Follow my order.
Cap Boy: Cross the forest first. And be quiet.

#有一处是zombie身上着火，其余zombie围着跳的。遇到那个地方之后剧情：
Princess: That's crazy...
Man: Yea. They are sensitive to the smell.
Princess: Maybe they are trying to save him.
Cap Boy: Maybe we should go. Quietly.

#这个地方如果主动攻击那些zombie，其余zombie也会过来攻击。

#以下是通用语音条。随机播放即可
#进战语音：
Princess: They notice us!
Man: Let the show begin!
Cap Boy: Troubles.

#受伤语音：
Princess: Uh!
Man: That bite is good.
Cap Boy: Mmm...!

#主角受伤语音：
Princess: You got bitten!
Man: Watch out!

#主角成功击中语音：
Princess: Yes! You did it!
Man: Nice shot!

#不能战斗语音：
Princess: Sorry, father...
Man: I need a break now...
Cap Boy: They are... very strong.

#到达barrenland地图。两侧均为barrenland，远处插着scare+crow和stop sign+pole。Stop sign根据远近会变化。一波遇敌。隐藏敌人两个。 scarecrow在靠近之后，scare会被撞碎，露出zombiecrow.png。另，在stopsign的另一侧有一个被打残了的zombie（zobi.png）。隐藏敌人可打可不打。

#剧情滚动字幕：（遇敌前）
Princess: It's so bleak...
Cap Boy: Em-hmm. Welcome to limbo.
Cap Boy: We need to turn right at that sign.

#遇到scarecrow怪：
Princess: Ah!!
Man: No worries. It's stuck.
Cap Boy: Keep focused.

#击倒遇敌后过了一会：（如果和princess的关系值高于xx）
Princess: *whisper* Knight.
Princess: *whisper* When we get to the city... take care of yourself.
Man: Something wrong back there?
Princess: No. I just miss my family.
Cap Boy: Lucky that you have a family to miss.

#遇到在地上的zobi：
Man: Gross...
Princess: Is he dead?
Cap Boy: Doesn't matter. Let's keep going.

#到达City地图。city地图的组成：building+builins+uidis任意组合，smoke，streetlamp，telegraphpole，ruins，和safehouse。走到safehouse即胜利。共遇敌一波，打完之后出现最后boss――超大zombie，画面里根本看不到头。

#剧情滚动字幕：（遇敌前）
Princess: This place looks totally different from my country...
Cap Boy: It's called City city.
Cap Boy: You see the safe house over there?
Princess: Yes.
Cap Boy: That's our destination.
Man: Alright guys, let's go on and kill them all!

#最后boss出现：
Cap Boy: Holy hell... *smile*
Man：Damn it! I can't reach you two! Run!!!
#与此同时zombie冲向princess和capboy。子弹时间（慢动作），两个人身边都有qte框（uiqte+savehim/saveher），只能选一个救。倒计时结束后没选择的话就两个都受伤。一击直接把hp削到1，然后剧情后不能战斗。

#救boy：
Princess: ...!!
Giant Zombie: ...#..&!?
Man: EAT THIS!!!
Giant Zombie: O...&^h@#!
#僵尸被击退到中间位置
Cap Boy: Thanks.
Man: Are you alright, little girl?
Princess: Sorry... I might... need a break. (love - 20)

#救princess：
Cap Boy: Eh...!
Giant Zombie: ...#..&!?
Man: EAT THIS!!!
Giant Zombie: O...&^h@#!
#僵尸被击退到中间位置
Princess: Thank you... Knight. (love + 20）
Man: Are you alright, boy?
Cap Boy: Nah... I better stay behind for a while.

#救援之后：
Giant Zombie: !!&^@!!
#随机播放：
Man: Shoot him! It might not crash him, but can blow it back!
Man: Come on! We know you can do it!
Man: We just need to blow off its head!
#多次攻击会使zombie退后，露出头，然后打头就能打死他。在zombie退后时没打头的话它还会回到中间位置。没有一直攻击zombie的话，zombie会上前咬人。根据还能战斗的组成，会先咬man -> princess/boy -> 主角。主角被咬后即死亡。

#成功打倒后：
Giant Zombie:!!!!
Giant Zombie:$%*.. fa$%e..$%r...
#zombie碎掉
Princess: Thank god it's gone...
Man: What the heck is that?
Cap Boy: It's... so strong...
Cap Boy: Let's hurry up.

#到safehouse 全白。
..."Close the door!"
#点击close the door，horror篇结束。
