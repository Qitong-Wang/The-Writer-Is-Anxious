#在上一幕点击出现的princess开始romance剧情。底色变成白色，frame放在四个角落。princess说话的时候就放normal+nametag+dialoguebox，有选项的时候对话框消失，三个选项框（choice）放在中间，竖着排开。表情有很多是为之后做的。下面文字中带括号的不出现在dialogue里，是表情/好感度变化。我还没想好要不要把好感度具象化。好感度可以为负，起始是30. 好感度上升的时候heart会出现。这个我之后做个动画。
#箭头是在dialogue下面放着的，可参考传统rpg/galgame那种，动来动去的。

I'd assume they are all fine then. (love-20)

#C:
Princess:
Oh... (Blush, love+20)

Princess:
So... what should we do now? Do you have any ideas, Knight?

#Choices:
We should go back to see King - he is so worried about you. ->A
I'm cool with anything. What about you? ->B
I will follow you to wherever you would like to go. ->C
