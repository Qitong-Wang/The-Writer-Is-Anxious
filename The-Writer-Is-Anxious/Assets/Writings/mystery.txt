Princess: 
Ha... ha... 

Princess: 
We're safe here, right?

Cap Boy: 
Yep. Just for now, though.

Man: 
What is this place? A lab?

Man: 
Where is this white door connected to?

Cap Boy: 
Don't touch anything!（画面振动）

Man: (speechless)
Wow. Okay-okay.

Cap Boy: 
Hey, two of you over there. You want the origin, right? Come and check this out.

Princess: 
Knight.

#这时，很多smoke从小变大掩盖了整个屏幕。之后全屏都有不同透明度的smoke。

Man: 
What the - What is going on?(无立绘）

#Bang字在背景右侧展现。

Does it hurt?
I can't feel anything.)
#渐变黑色 再渐变回来 eye.png 此时背景多了princess的脚

#点击blurs达成romance be

#如果与公主好感度到达60：
Knight:

Knight:
(What happens?
Where is Princess?)

#过了一会 浓烟渐渐散了（透明度0）
Man:
Fuck the smoke grenade!
Who the fuck did that?

Man:
Wait...
Where is that boy?

Princess:
... (scared)

Knight:
(I saw her sitting on the ground near the white door, eyes wandering to her front.)

Knight:
Princess?

Princess:
... (scared)

Knight:
(She gasps.)

Princess:(tears)
He's dead.
It's all my fault...

Man:
What?!

Knight:
(We quickly ran to the white door.)

#镜头回来。
Princess: (tears)
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...

Man:
You said it was your fault. What happened?

Princess: (scared)
When the smoke bursts out, I was freaked out. I didn't know what to do.
Then I bumped into Cap Boy. He dragged me into this white door. He said it would be safe there.
It was a garage behind that door. We talked a little about the strange smoke. Suddenly these green creatures broke in and attacked him. Soon he knelt in the blood.
I tried to help... But Cap Boy asked me to escape. I'm so sorry for what happened...

Knight:
(...)

Knight:
(It is still hard to believe that the boy, who always carried the baseball bat, who confidently led us here, died just now.)

Knight:
(But I did hear a gunfire...)

Knight:
(Is she really telling the truth? Or...)

#investigation starts标语。（还没做，忘了）
#每次发现证据右面才会显示该证据。右面的menu出现，是当前证据+sidebar+evidence+triangle.
#点击evidence出现证据框，是当前证据+evidencemenu。当前证据放在左面。点击back返回。

#hint1: gunfire添加到线索栏。Gunfire: You heard a gunfire in the smoke. It was a huge noise. No one could miss it.
#点击地上报纸获得hint2: news.
That is a newspaper with research reporting that the surrounding areas of safe houses were proved to be safe and zombie-free.
Reasons to this phenomenon remained a mystery.
#点击white door获得hint3: Cap Boy
He lied straight, face down to the ground. A lot of zombies surround him. It's even hard to recognize his face.
He didn't seem to have brought any weapons with him.
#地上会有很多dust，拖动一下就会消失。 右下角有很多dust，都移走之后发现hint4: blood stain.
The blood is very fresh. Whose blood can it possibly be?
#和man对话获得hint5: Immunity
Man:
Knight...
I can't believe this is real.
We were the best adventure buddies. He was like my little brother - brave, calm, smart... although I've only known him for two days.

Man:
Did I remember anything?
Mmm...
He seemed to be very familiar with those zoobees.

Man:
At the first time we met the zonbikes, he was bit by one of them. I freaked out - I thought he would become one of them.
But he just let me calm down, and said that he was immune to their virus.
Ahh... I miss those days we were together!

#再和公主对话进入审问 
Are you ready for the cross-examination?

Then suddenly everything changed. You've ruined EVERYTHING!
