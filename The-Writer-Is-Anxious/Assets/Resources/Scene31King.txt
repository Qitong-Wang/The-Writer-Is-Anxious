(King open)
I shall await thy return with Princess, my brave Knight.
(option Ask Leave )
Ask where Princess went.
Leave.
(Ask)
The princess Princess was taken away by the accursed Dragon out of the town.
Long has he become the threat of our land.
So I say unto thee - vanquish the evil monster hiding under the darkness, and bring Princess back to me.
May the victory be with you, Knight!
