When the smoke bursts out, I was freaked out. I didn't know what to do.
Then I bumped into Cap Boy. He dragged me into this white door. He said it would be safe there.
It was a garage behind that door. We talked a little about the strange smoke. 
Suddenly these green creatures broke in and attacked him. Soon he knelt in the blood.
I tried to help... But Cap Boy asked me to escape. I'm so sorry for what happened...

I can't believe this is real.
We were the best adventure buddies. 
He was like my little brother - brave, calm, smart... although I've only known him for two days.
Did I remember anything?
Mmm...
He seemed to be very familiar with those zoobees.
At the first time we met the zonbikes, he was bit by one of them. I freaked out - I thought he would become one of them.
But he just let me calm down, and said that he was immune to their virus.
Ahh... I miss those days we were together!
(#MysteryWithoutTag)
As Man remembered, Cap Boy was bit once but didn’t transform. He said he was immune to the zombie virus.
