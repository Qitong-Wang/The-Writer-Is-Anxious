When the smoke bursts out, I was freaked out. I didn't know what to do.
Then I bumped into Cap Boy. He dragged me into this white door. He said it would be safe there.
It was a garage behind that door. We talked a little about the strange smoke. 
Suddenly these green creatures broke in and attacked him. Soon he knelt in the blood.
I tried to help... But Cap Boy asked me to escape. I'm so sorry for what happened...

(Think)(It is still hard to believe that the boy, who always carried the baseball bat, who confidently led us here, died just now.)
(Think)(But I did hear a gunfire...)
(Think)(Is she really telling the truth? Or...)

That is a newspaper with research reporting that the surrounding areas of safe houses were proved to be safe and zombie-free.
Reasons to this phenomenon remained a mystery.

He lied straight, face down to the ground. A lot of zombies surround him. It's even hard to recognize his face.
He didn't seem to have brought any weapons with him.

Knight...
I can't believe this is real.
We were the best adventure buddies. 
He was like my little brother - brave, calm, smart... although I've only known him for two days.
Did I remember anything?
Mmm...
He seemed to be very familiar with those zoobees.
At the first time we met the zonbikes, he was bit by one of them. I freaked out - I thought he would become one of them.
But he just let me calm down, and said that he was immune to their virus.
Ahh... I miss those days we were together!
(#MysteryWithoutTag)
As Man remembered, Cap Boy was bit once but didn’t transform. He said he was immune to the zombie virus.
