When the smoke bursts out, I was freaked out. I didn't know what to do.
Then I bumped into Cap Boy. He dragged me into this white door. He said it would be safe there.
It was a garage behind that door. We talked a little about the strange smoke. 
Suddenly these green creatures broke in and attacked him. Soon he knelt in the blood.
I tried to help... But Cap Boy asked me to escape. I'm so sorry for what happened...

(Think)(It is still hard to believe that the boy, who always carried the baseball bat, who confidently led us here, died just now.)
(Think)(But I did hear a gunfire...)
(Think)(Is she really telling the truth? Or...)
