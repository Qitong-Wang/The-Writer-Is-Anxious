My name is Princess, the Princess of Country.

Please let me express my gratitude and respect for your courage and selflessness.
Could you tell me what happened to the town after I was caught, Knight?
Is everyone okay? Is my father okay?
(option3 Father_1 Father_2 Father_3 )
There has not been much change since you left, your majesty.
How exactly do you get caught? ->B
We are all worrying about you. But I had faith that I could find you.

We should go back to see King - he is so worried about you.
I'm cool with anything. What about you?
I will follow you to wherever you would like to go.
